                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <p>2 packets (4 1/2 tsp) Active Dry Yeast</p>
                <p>2 1/4 c (540ml) warm Water (110℉-115℉)</p>
                <p>2 tsp Sugar</p>
                <p>2 tsp Salt</p>
                <p>2 Tbsp Olive Oil</p>
                <p>6 c Bread Flour</p>
                <p>1.5 Tbsp Garlic Powder</p>
                <p>1.5 Tbsp Italian Seasoning</p>
                <p>1.5 Tbsp Rosemary</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>1. Pour warm Water over Yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with dough hook attachment. Whisk together and allow to sit for 5 minutes, until mixture is frothy and foamy.</p>
                <p>2. While mixing on low, add Sugar, Salt, Olive Oil, 4 c Bread Flour, and seasonings. Beat on low speed for 1 minute, then add remaining 2 cups of flour.</p>
                <p>3. Knead the dough in the mixer, beating for 5-6 minutes. Add flour 1 tsp at a time as needed to acheive a soft, slightly tacky dough.</p>
                <p>4. Form into ball and place into a large greased bowl, turning to grease top of bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in warm environment to rise until doubled in size, about 90 minutes.</p>
                <p>5. Punch down dough to release air bubbles. Remove dough from bowl, turning out onto lightly floured surface.</p>
                <p>6. Cut into 6 even pieces. Form each into a ball.</p>
                <p>7. Line 2 large baking pans with parchment paper. Place 3 dough balls on each, cover lightly, and set aside for 20 minutes to rest.</p>
                <p>8. Preheat oven to 400℉. Brush each dough ball with Egg Wash, and score an X into the tops of each with a sharp knife.</p>
                <p>9. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Bread bowls are done when center is 195℉</p>
                <p>10. Let cool. Cut a large round out of the top and scoop out the center to fill with soup.</p>
